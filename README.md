# Screen Dash Fixer

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/neos-modding-group/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that is a spinoff of 3D Dash On Screen, minus 3D dash and UI editing. That means userspace is fixed to not stuff things into overlay, Camera UI is restored into its VR behavior and can be also unhooked from its slider in mod config, desktop tab control panel keybind is restored and configurable in mod config, and floating VR style notifications are also restored

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
1. Place [ScreenDashFixer.dll](https://github.com/rampa3/ScreenDashFixer/releases/latest/download/ScreenDashFixer.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
1. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
